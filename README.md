# KraveKitchen-Assignment-3
Krave Kitchen is a small Progressive Web App I made to keep track of recipes. You can browse recipes, view them, and “add” new ones (it’s a prototype, so it doesn’t save permanently yet).

## Features
- Works offline with a service worker
- Can be added to your home screen like an app

## How to test
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Make sure the service worker is registered (in DevTools → Application → Service Workers).
3. Go offline and navigate the app — it should still work.
4. On mobile, try “Add to Home Screen” to see it as an installable app.
